		<p class="subtitle">101 reasons to make something eventhough it already exists</p>

	</div>

	<p>Here’s a topic I’ve wanted to write about for some time now. It’s a problem I come across almost daily - 'Someone has already built my idea so what’s the point?' Or 'If something similar exists why don’t I just use it?'</p>

	<p>I encountered this problem a lot when I first got into tech, but soon came to realise it was everywhere; in almost every creative pursuit you are likely to find someone or a number of people who have the exact same idea as you. It happened a lot in photography, business and especially in design where it was encouraged to build and improve upon existing ideas.</p>

	<p>It can be demoralising at first, stumbling on something you've been planning to build for while. But as time went on, and I pushed my ideas back I realised I was the only one missing out on ideas that I needed. Not other founders who were pushing their ideas. Sometimes this resistance presents itself as good reasons why you shouldn’t build an idea and sometimes its just procrastination disguised.</p>

	<p>I wanted to write about this because among the 101 other things that may get in the way of an idea being manifested into the physical world, a lot of people (myself included) generally put off good, worthy ideas because something similar already exists. However, a helpful question to ask is: Is this the best the idea could ever be? Are the creators doing it justice or as well as they can? Are they innovating?</p>

	<p>Among Thomas Edison’s 1000+ patents majority of his popular ideas were innovations on pre-existing ideas; imagine if he didn't try to improve the lightbulb, phonograph or motion picture camera because they alredy existed.</p>

	<p>So after much needed waffling here are 101 reasons (40 really) to make something even though it already exists:
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>Ownership of your ideas</li>
				<li>Its confirmation that the tech exists</li>
				<li>Its confirmation of a market</li>
				<li>To provide alternatives</li>
				<li>Competition</li>
				<li>Servicing a local market</li>
				<li>You may be able to provide better/different branding, design or experience</li>
				<li>Better marketing or sales strategy</li>
				<li>Better customer service</li>
				<li>To get a share of the market</li>
				<li>You can provide a higer quality product</li>
				<li>Different/better problem solving skills</li>
				<li>To service a particular audience like people who may want a luxury experience or people who may want a cheaper alternative</li>
				<li>An opportunity to improve or innovate on existing ideas</li>
				<li>Existing ideas might be bad/underdeveloped, or creators have a different path, vision or mission.</li>
				<li>Service (your contribution to the world)</li>
				<li>Expressing your point of view</li>
				<li>For diversity purposes</li>
				<li>For practice</li>
				<li>Because you never know what opportunitites might come from it</li>
				<li>The parable of the talents</li>
				<li>Because YOU care even if no one else does</li>
				<li>A way of giving back, paying it forward</li>
				<li>Democratising design</li>
				<li>Because first doesn’t always mean best</li>
				<li>Different business model</li>
				<li>Different timing</li>
				<li>You can offer more value</li>
				<li>Your unique background and all the vectors and intersections that flow into your school of thought (for instance my background is in business, the arts (photography, filmmaking & creative direction), sports, tech, design and a bit of psychology; naturally I bring a different flair or perspective to everything I do and I can see how all these disciplines flow into each other)</li>
				<li>An opportunity to combine different disciplines</li>
				<li>Simply for egoic reasons - sometimes just to see if you can, its not a bad thing if you are aware of this. Cos yes, why not use what already exists?</li>
				<li>To learn how to manifest ideas into the physical realm</li>
				<li>To fulfil your potential</li>
				<li>To gain and develop new skills</li>
				<li>A different, creative or more artistic approach</li>
				<li>To maximise your luck</li>
				<li>Because your unique background/experience might make you the best person suited for this problem</li>
				<li>The way you see art or life</li>
				<li>Just showing up gets you further than inaction</li>
				<li>As protest</li>
		</ol>

			<p>Finally, a part of me also wrote this for myself, in case I ever get stuck on an idea.<p/>
