            <p>I’m hoping this blog will do for someone what YC’s startup school, PG’s essays or Virgil’s free game did for me. Mostly, I’m selfishly creating it for myself, but it could be of use to others like me or some 16yo rn who feels lost and hasn’t developed the know-how of how to make productive use of their time - this is just one way.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>The list below is an unexhaustive list, but they are the resources that I feel for me, have stood the test of time. I will definitely be updating it if there's anything I've forgotten or new ones to add.</p>

            <p class="boldtext">Where to get ideas</p>
            <p>For me there are two ways to get ideas, internally & externally</p>

            <h4>Internally</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Solving a pain problem in your life</li>
                <li>Your Passion</li>
                <li>Something you do really well</li>
                <li>Dreams</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Externally</h4>
                <p>These are some of my favourite places to get ideas when looking externally:</p>
                <li>Books</li>
                <li>Business Channels</li>
                <li>Sci fi films</li>
                <li>Cartoons</li>
                <li>Conversations</li>

            <div>
                <p class="boldtext">Where to focus ideas</p>
                    <p>It's one thing to have good ideas, it's another skill entirely knowing which ones to focus all your time and energy on. There's no correct answer to this as it's more an art than a science but for my personality type a great place to start is Maslow's hierarchy of needs (something I took from PG's essays), as to void having existential crises lol. If you are working on a clear need that solves a problem for millions it's hard to convince yourself that all your work is pointless on the tough days.</p>
